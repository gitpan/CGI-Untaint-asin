NAME
    CGI::Untaint::asin - validate an Amazon ID

SYNOPSIS
      use CGI::Untaint;
      my $handler = CGI::Untaint->new($q->Vars);

      my $url = $handler->extract( -as_asin => 'id' );

DESCRIPTION
    This CGI::Untaint input handler verifies that it is dealing with a
    plausible Amazon ID (asin). It does not (yet?) check that this is a
    *real* asin, just that it looks like one.
